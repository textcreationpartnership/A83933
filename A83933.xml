         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E doubt not but that the well affected Citizens of <hi>London</hi> are ſenſible of the preſent and great cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the State, the Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and that they doe with a knowing compaſſion conſider the diſtreſſes of them all three, and how they lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh in expectation that ſome remedy may be provided to binde up the bleeding wounds of this diſtracted and divided Nation.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:156304:3"/>That the head and body of this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth may ſubmit to an obedient relation, and in a peaceable maner come to an uniform perfection, that ſchiſmes cryed up by popular ignorance, may by a loving and juditious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement be annihilated into that nothing of merit and ſpirituall ambition from whence they did firſt ariſe. We doubt not moreover but that the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> have taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to conſideration the bloody effects of war, and what a ſad character it wil preſent to after ages, where they ſhall reade or heare of a Land wherein peace and glory had choſen to inherit and quietly in every poore village to dwell together, ſhould now be made a prey to the cruelty of a Civil war, which word doth include theſe miſeries following. The violent plundering of houſes, and taking away of their goods; nay, oftentimes there have, if they offered to make any reſiſtance, the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating of Churches, as the blinded rage of ſome Souldiers lately committed at <hi>Worceſter, Canterbury,</hi> and other Cathedrals, beſides the cruell effuſion of blood at divers places, but moſt eſpecially at <hi>Kenton</hi> bartail, which the mercie of our gratious Soveraigne would fain have avoided, and may inſtruct all good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that the ſword is the cruell executioner of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:156304:3"/>Gods wrath and anger, and is a deare and coſtly way both of life &amp; ſtate to obtain peace, when it may by gentle and ſoft meanes bee ſooner gotten, for if there ſhould bee a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant oppoſition, as there hath been hitherto, nothing is to bee expected but the ruine and deſolation of this Kingdome, that good men ſhould be a weary of living in ſuch a cruel and diſtracted time, wherein Juſtice, Loyalty, and Religion can protect them from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of domeſtike fury and cruelty, and if this war ſhould continue, the husband man who is the beſt victualler of the City, muſt be forced to forſake and leave off his tillage, and then muſt neceſſarily follow a great dearth and ſcarcity throughout the whole Land.</p>
            <p>Beſides, we underſtand that you the loyal and wel affected Citizens of <hi>London</hi> cannot be in any quiet ſafety within your own houſes, loe there are a company of giddy heads round about the Citie that had rather ſee the ruine and overthrow of this Kingdome then to bee conformable to their King in his moſt merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deſires of peace, they deſire that the Church and Common-wealth ſhould ſtil ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that they may in Conventicles deſpiſe all things in themſelves who are indeed arrogant and execrable perſons valuing their own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:156304:4"/>opinions at a higher rate then the peace and happineſſe of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
            <p>But as wee deſire the converſion of ſuch, ſo wee do not apply this our meſſage unto them, but to all Loving, Religious, Loyall and well affected Citizens, we earneſtly deſire to take into conſideration, the preſent diſtreſſed eſtate of this Kingdom, as we have ſet it out in this preſent Meſſage; and ſince there is no true hearted Subject but doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedly wiſh and deſire that there might be a happy ceſſation of this civill war, that the King and Kingdom might enjoy one another, that true Religion hitherto made ſcandalous and without ſhade, defence or protection, (but that God and His Majeſty have ſtood for it) may to the comfort of all true Proteſtants flouriſh again in this Kingdom. We doe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with intimation of our places of being Privy Counſellours to the Kings ſacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; and out of our tender care for the good and proſperity of this City and Kingdom, heartily and lovingly deſire you to take unto you hearts, actively, obediently, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying to a happy union and peace, between the Kings Majeſty and this preſent Parli: not doubting but your forwardneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156304:4"/>will be very acceptable unto them, and your willingneſſe to promote &amp; give the firſt moving to an accommodation of peace ſo generally deſired by the beſt &amp; well affected ſubjects of this Kingdom: wee have juſtly condeſcended in a loving way to make known our eſtates unto you, and to move uno you that the generall votes and deſires of the City may in a ſubſtantiall and judicious Petition with all convenient opportunity bee preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and tendred to the two Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who it may be doe expect by ſuch a brief information, to bee certified of your inclinations to deſire a firme and ſetled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of peace throughout the whole Kingdom. And as we doe vrge this peaceable motion, being thought in our conſultations worthy your allowance &amp; approbation, ſo we promiſe to joyne with you in advancing and bringing about a proſperous peace for the generall good of the Kingdome.</p>
